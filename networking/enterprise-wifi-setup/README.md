# Connect to Enterprise Wi-Fi Using nmcli on Ubuntu 24.04

This guide explains how to connect to an Enterprise Wi-Fi network (such as a university or workplace WPA2-Enterprise network) using `nmcli`, the command-line tool for NetworkManager.

---

## 1. Check your wireless adapter

List all network devices to find your wireless interface name.

```bash
nmcli device status
```

Look for your wireless adapter. It is usually named `wlan0` or something similar like `wlp3s0`. Note this name for the next steps.

---

## 2. Scan for available Wi-Fi networks

See which Wi-Fi networks are available and get the exact SSID.

```bash
nmcli device wifi list
```

Find the SSID you want to connect to. Make sure you have the correct name.

---

## 3. Add the Wi-Fi connection

Replace `wlan0` with your wireless adapter name.
Replace `MySSID` with the SSID of your network.
Replace `MyEnterpriseWiFi` with any name you want to use for this connection.

```bash
nmcli connection add type wifi ifname wlan0 con-name "MyEnterpriseWiFi" ssid "MySSID"
```

---

## 4. Configure Enterprise authentication settings

Modify the connection with your username and password for the network.

Replace `TheUserName` with your network username.
Replace `NetworkPassword` with your network password.

```bash
nmcli connection modify "MyEnterpriseWiFi" \
  802-1x.eap peap \
  802-1x.identity "TheUserName" \
  802-1x.phase2-auth mschapv2 \
  802-1x.password "NetworkPassword"
```

---

## 5. Set the key management to WPA-EAP

Enterprise Wi-Fi uses WPA-EAP.

```bash
nmcli connection modify "MyEnterpriseWiFi" wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-eap
```

---

## 6. Connect to the Wi-Fi network

Bring up the connection you created.

```bash
nmcli connection up "MyEnterpriseWiFi"
```

If your details are correct, you should now be connected to the network.

---

## Additional checks and tips

Show all saved connections:

```bash
nmcli connection show
```

Check the status of your devices:

```bash
nmcli device status
```

Bring up the connection again if needed:

```bash
nmcli connection up "MyEnterpriseWiFi"
```

If you run into problems, you can check the NetworkManager logs for details:

```bash
journalctl -u NetworkManager
```

This method works for many WPA2-Enterprise networks that use PEAP with MSCHAPv2 (common in universities and workplaces). Some networks may require additional certificate settings. Always follow your network administratorâ€™s instructions if they provide extra configuration details.
